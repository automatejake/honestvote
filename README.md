## Purpose
Elections are an important fabric of modern society.  They are responsible for choosing leadership of school boards that set the direction for our communities, executives that set the direction for publicly traded companies,  and politicians that set the direction of our nation.  An equitable society hinges on the ability to conduct safe, transparent, and anonymous elections.  These issues have always raised concern since the dawn of organized civilization.  Recently, concerns have arisen that the security of US elections may have been compromised and that governments in some countries may be repressing the true results of elections.  Honestvote eliminates many of these worries.

This project was created to explore alternative methods of voting and our goal is to have West Chester University use our blockchain for student elections in the Spring of 2020.
