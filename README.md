# HonestVote.io

## Purpose
The world is in need of more secure voting and blockchain offers a very vialbe solution as voters can trace back their votes to a candidate. Blockchain offers an extremely transparent ledger to the public that cannot be tampered with while maintaining anonymity.

This project was created to explore alternative methods of voting and our goal is to have West Chester University use our blockchain for student elections in the Spring of 2020.
