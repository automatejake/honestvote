# Making Elections Decentralized and Transparent

The world is in need of more secure voting and blockchain offers a very vialbe solution as voters can trace back their votes to a candidate. Blockchain offers an extremely transparent ledger to the public that cannot be tampered with.

This project was created to explore alternative methods of voting and our current goal is to get West Chester University to use our blockchain for student elections in the Spring of 2020.

Stay tuned for more updates! In a few months, we will have a blog and videos coming.
